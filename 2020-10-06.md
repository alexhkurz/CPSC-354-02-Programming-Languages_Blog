# Installing Haskell and BNFC on MacOS
  
Installing Haskell and BNFC is very easy on a mac compared to a windows device.  
  
## Installing Haskell  
  
The first step is to open terminal on your mac.  
Next, copy paste the line below into your terminal enter it:  
`curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh`  
You may get some instructions to follow which should be fairly simple to install the tools  
At this point haskell should be installed, and you can check this by entering:  
`stack exec ghci`  
which should launch the interactice haskell console compiler.  
Professor Kurz provided us with some aliases to make it easier to use the haskell commands in the terminal:  
`export PROMPT='%~> '`  
`alias vs='open -a visual\ studio\ code'`  
`alias la='ls -a'`  
`alias ghci='stack exec ghci'`  
To make use of the aliases you must put them into your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` file, depending on if you use bash or zsh  
If you do not have the `.zshrc` file, you can enter the below into your command prompt to create it:  
`nano ~/.zshrc`  
Then simply save the file, and it will be created. This line uses nano to create the `.zshrc` file in your home directory  
Haskell should now be installed and instead of having to type  
`stack exec ghci`  
you should now be able to use  
`ghci`  
to open the haskell console  
  
  
## Installing BNFC  
  
The first step is to open terminal on your mac.  
Next, copy paste the line below into your terminal enter it:  
`brew install bnfc`  
BNFC should now be installed. To check if it is, go to this [link](https://github.com/alexhkurz/programming-languages-2020/tree/master/src/Calculator3) and download and put the files into a folder. Navigate to the folder, and try running this:  
`bnfc -m --haskell numbers.cf`  
and then:  
`make`  
You may have an issue where it can't find `alex`, in which case try:  
`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh`  
`cabal install alex`  
`cabal install happy`  
If this does not work, enter this in your terminal:  
`source ~/.ghcup/env`  
and then try doing the curl and cabal commands again. Then run the bnfc and make commands again.  
  
To test if this worked, enter the below line in the terminal:  
`echo "1+2*3" | ./TestNumbers`  
You should receive:  
`Parse Successful!`  
  
`[Abstract Syntax]`  
  
`Plus (Num 1) (Times (Num 2) (Num 3))`  
  
`[Linearized tree]`  
  
`1 + 2 * 3`
